Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`.

The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset has 12 classes (labels) like agriculture, health, and protection. \n",
